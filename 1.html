    <h3>Hello people of the earth,</h3>
    <img src= "photo.jpg" width="10%"><br><br>
    My name is <strong> Yeonju <u> Janice </u> Lee </strong>
    and my strengths are
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="2.html" target="_blank"> positive energy</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="3.html" target="_blank"> endurance </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="4.html" target="_blank"> and communication skill </a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Today, I would like to share a few stories about my life and how I got to acquire these aspects in life.
      <br> If you feel like skipping any part of the story, please feel free to leave anytime!
    </p>
    The most recent job I had before I came back to Korea was at
    <a href="https://www.abkco.com/" target="_blank" title="ABKCO Website"> ABKCO Music & Records, Inc.</a>
    as a Business Operations Specialist. <br>You might think "hmm I've never heard about that company."
    Quite frankly, I had not heard about this company either. <br>However, once I start dropping some names,
    you will realize that most names sound familiar.
